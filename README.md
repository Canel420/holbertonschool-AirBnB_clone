![HBNB](hbnh.png)

This is the first step towards building a full web application called: **the AirBnB clone**. 
This repository will create the command interpreter needed to be able to manage the objects of the web application:
* Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place).
* Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…
* Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…).
* Update attributes of an object
Destroy an object.
